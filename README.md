# CoffeeMachineAPI

This application provides REST API for basic library activities. For the POC sake, application uses in-memory derby database and thus all the data will be lost once the application is restarted. The REST API will be available on http://localhost:8080/{urls}

# API Documentation
Swagger is used along with springfox libraries to generate documentation. Once the application is started the documentation will be available on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/

# Thought for developing the API
1) This will provide the Api to display in Menu with Price Information
2) Selection of an Item but pricing/payment is not considered
